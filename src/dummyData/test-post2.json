You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? All I&#8217;ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. <strong>Simple.</strong> <em>What could possibly go wrong?</em> No… It&#8217;s a thing; it&#8217;s like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No, I&#8217;ll fix it. I&#8217;m good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I&#8217;m the Doctor. Don&#8217;t call me the Rotmeister.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Saving the world with meals on wheels. You hit me with a cricket bat. It&#8217;s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It&#8217;s art!

Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you?

Well, they call me the Doctor. I don&#8217;t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don&#8217;t know why. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I&#8217;m a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? They&#8217;re not aliens, they&#8217;re Earth…liens! I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I&#8217;ve always known him: Jeff. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don&#8217;t lie to me! Saving the world with meals on wheels. I hate yogurt.
